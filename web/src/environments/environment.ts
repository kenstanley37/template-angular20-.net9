export const environment = {
    production: true,
    apiUrl: 'https://api.yourdomain.com/api',
};
// This file contains the environment configuration for the application.
// It exports an object with the following properties:
// - production: Indicates whether the application is in production mode.
// - apiUrl: The base URL for the API endpoints.
//
// This configuration is used throughout the application to make API calls and manage environment-specific settings.
// The `environment` object is imported in various parts of the application to access the API URL and determine if the application is running in production mode.
// The `environment` object is used in services, components, and other parts of the application to ensure consistent API endpoint usage and to enable or disable features based on the environment.
// If the backend is unreachable, it will return a generic error message.
// If the error is a client-side error, it will return the error message from the event.
// If the error is a server-side error, it will return the error message from the response body.
// This file is typically replaced during the build process with the appropriate environment file based on the build configuration.
// The `environment` object is used in the `ConfigService` to load the API URL and other configuration settings.
// The `environment` object is also used in the `AuthService` to make API calls for authentication and user management.
